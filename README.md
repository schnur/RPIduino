# RPIduino
Project to design open source circuits and software for use in education

## Business plan
Create kits with all the parts needed for a circuit and sell them to teachers/tech camps looking to use them for their classes/workshops. The value proposition is that it's much simpler/easier to purchase premade kits from us instead of sourcing all the parts yourself.

This project uses the GPL v3 License to make sure that any improvements on our circuit designs or software stays open and free for use in education.
